e-Doctor: Medical appointment booking and Hospital management system

The aim is to build a platform online (web application) that will remove the hassle and help in seamless medical help to all the residents. Medical history and symptoms are very important for a doctor for a diagnosis. The medical file is easily misplaced and hence no proper information is available for the doctors and this web application will help a patient, a doctor, and the store to track and ease accessibility. Giving an overview, Patients and Doctors can log in themselves on the platform. The Patient can take appointments for specialists. Online consultation sessions with doctors can also be booked according to their schedule. Online counseling services can be another added advantage. This will be an initiative to improve the medical system of the institute.

### Product Perspective and Scope:
1.) For the beautiful designing of the webpage, we will use HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP.  <br/>
2.) To program the responses of the webpage we will use JavaScript, JQuery, JSON. <br/>
3.) For the backend, we will use PHP and manage the database we will use MYSQL. <br/>
4.) To make online consultation possible through video call we will be using the API of any online meeting app. <br/>

During the pandemic, we all have realized the importance of health and as of now, our institution does not have any online portal concerning the health care of students. Now times have changed, Social distancing is going to be a regular part of our lifestyles for the next couple of years so amidst all of the circumstances present or which may arise in the near future it has now become important to take into account the methods which will improve the health care system in our campus. Some major problems which health center might face after all students return to the campus:-

1.) Management of social distancing. <br/>
2.) Consultation of patients without having the fear of being infected or fear of the health center being contaminated. <br/>
3.) No health record in their database for future consultations. And many more problems…. <br/>

*Now rectification of all these problems lies in technology and making the healthcare system digital. In order to do this, our team has come up with a solution. We plan to come up with a 24/7 online web portal for the institute. In this portal, the patient will first send a request to the health center through the webpage and The patient will be given a time and date through email AND in his/her profile and further online consultation can either be arranged through any platform available for the online meeting through a link which will be sent by health center via mail or also meeting can be arranged through API of any online meeting platform that we will include in the webpage, The features we plan to include are:-

1.) For the patient: Online consultation of patients with appointment –This would help to rectify the problem of management of social distancing and consultation of patients without having the fear of being infected or fear of the health center being contaminated. <br/>
2.) For doctor: Understanding symptoms – This will include a list of symptoms of major illnesses that will help patients to self consult before consulting the doctor. <br/>
3.) For admin and Doctor: The option of viewing health records of patients – The member of the institution can log in to their account and all of their previous health histories will appear, This will be very helpful to the doctors as in case of any health complications knowing the health history of the patient is a must. <br/>
4.) For the patient: Special consultations – For the consultation of physiotherapy etc. 5.) For everyone: Special link for coronavirus information. <br/>
